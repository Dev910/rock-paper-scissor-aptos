This Is A **Rock Paper Scissor Game Made On Aptos Using Move Programming Language**. This Game Can Only Be **Played** On The **Block Explorer**. A Demonstration Of This Game Has Been Shown In The **Video Attached Below**.

First You Will Have To Install Aptos CLI In Your Local Machine. You Can Refer To This Link For The Tutorial _https://aptos.dev/en/build/cli_ 

I Am Using Windows And Was Experiencing Some Issues Using The Python Script So What Worked For Me Was :- 

      1)Downloading The .exe File From The Link _https://aptos.dev/en/build/cli/install-cli/install-cli-windows_ 
      
      2) Copying The Extracted .exe Application's Path Using ctrl + shift + c
      
      3) Opening New Terminal (Powershell) Inside VS Code And Writing The Command
      _C:\Users\<username>\Downloads\aptos-cli-3.1.0-Windows-x86_64\aptos.exe help_
      
      (You Have To Write Your File Path And Then Add Help At The End)

After Installing Aptos CLI, Check If It Has Been Correctly Installed By Using The Command "aptos info"

Then Refer To The Attached Video To Play The Game.

P.S. :-

If You Are Using Google Cloud Shell Then :-

      1) You Will Have To Type In The Command :- 
      _curl -fsSL "https://aptos.dev/scripts/install_cli.py" | python3_
      To Install The Aptos CLI

      2) Then, If Prompted To, Run The Command Provided In Your 
      Terminal Output To Add The Aptos CLIâ€™s 
      Bin Directory To Your PATH Environment Variable. 
      
      For Example :- export PATH="/home/user_name/.local/bin:$PATH"

      3) Type In The Command "aptos info" To Check If Aptos Has 
      Been Correctly Installed Or Not
